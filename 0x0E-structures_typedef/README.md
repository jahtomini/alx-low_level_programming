# Structures, typedef

`struct` in C allows the creation of custom data types that contain grouped variables that are not only similar because they belong to a similar structure but because they are physically kept together in memory.

`typedef` allows for a struct to also be accessible by a different name. The syntax is `typedef name new_name`.
