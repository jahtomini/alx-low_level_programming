# 0x09 - Static libraries

A static library is a collection of object files used in the linking phase of compilation which can later be used in the executable file of a program. They can be generated using archiving tools like `ar` and then indexed using the command `ranlib`.

This directory contains a script called [create-static-lib.sh](./create-static-lib.sh) that demonstrates this simple process.
